In this assignment I use the 4-th method for computing the mean, SD and median, i.e. I use R to read blocks and use the shell to extract the ArrDelay column.
I use the frequency table approach to evaluate the median.

Currently the program is designed to be able to handle a series of *.csv.bz2 file in a single directory with column "ArrDelay" in the 15th column. In my test we processed the filde "1990.csv.bz2".

The resulting mean, sample variance and median of ArrDelay are 6.809947, 616.9206 (which means SD is 24.83789) and the median is 2.

To run this code, simply place the file "AnalyzeArrDelay.R" in the same directory containing the files specified above and type the command
$ Rscript AnalyzeArrDelay.R

The time to complete the computation on "1990.csv.bz2" is

I am running R in VirtualBox with Ubuntu 13.10 hosted in Windows 7 64bit. The amount of RAM for the virtual machine is 2GB and the CPU is Intel(R) Core i7-3612QM 2.10GHz.
